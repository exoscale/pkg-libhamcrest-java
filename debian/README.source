 REPACKAGING

 The upstream supplied source package contains binary jar files,
 and hence upstream sources have been repackaged. Please use the
 get-orig-source target from debian/rules to create the orig.tar.gz
 used for Debian packaging. For more details on repackaging of
 upstream sources please see the debian/orig-tar.sh file.
